defmodule EventStore do
  @moduledoc """
  EventStore allows you to define one or more event store modules to append,
  read, and subscribe to streams of events.

  It uses PostgreSQL (v9.5 or later) as the underlying storage engine.

  ## Defining an event store

  We can define an event store in our own application as follows:

      defmodule MyApp.EventStore do
        use EventStore,
          otp_app: :my_app

        # Optional `init/1` function to modify config at runtime.
        def init(config) do
          {:ok, config}
        end
      end

  Where the configuration for the event store must be in your application
  environment, usually defined in `config/config.exs`:

      config :my_app, MyApp.EventStore,
        serializer: EventStore.JsonSerializer,
        username: "postgres",
        password: "postgres",
        database: "eventstore",
        hostname: "localhost",
        # OR use a URL to connect instead
        url: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/eventstore",
        pool_size: 1

  **Note:** To use an EventStore with Commanded you should configure the event
  store to use Commanded's JSON serializer which provides additional support for
  JSON decoding:

      config :my_app, MyApp.EventStore, serializer: Commanded.Serialization.JsonSerializer

  The event store module defines a `start_link/1` function that needs to be
  invoked before using the event store. In general, this function is not
  called directly, but included as part of your application supervision tree.

  If your application was generated with a supervisor (by passing `--sup`
  to `mix new`) you will have a `lib/my_app/application.ex` file
  containing the application start callback that defines and starts your
  supervisor. You just need to edit the `start/2` function to start the event
  store in your application's supervisor:

        def start(_type, _args) do
          children = [
            MyApp.EventStore
          ]

          opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
          Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
        end

  Each event store module (e.g. `MyApp.EventStore`) provides a public API to
  read events from and write events to an event stream, and subscribe to event
  notifications.

  Create a transient subscription to a given stream.

    - `stream_uuid` is the stream to subscribe to.
      Use the `$all` identifier to subscribe to events from all streams.

    - `opts` is an optional map providing additional subscription configuration:
      - `name` the name of the event store if provided to `start_link/1`.
      - `selector` to define a function to filter each event, i.e. returns
        only those elements for which fun returns a truthy value
      - `mapper` to define a function to map each recorded event before sending
        to the subscriber.

  The calling process will be notified whenever new events are appended to
  the given `stream_uuid`.

  As the subscription is transient you do not need to acknowledge receipt of
  each event. The subscriber process will miss any events if it is restarted
  and resubscribes. If you need a persistent subscription with guaranteed
  at-least-once event delivery and back-pressure you should use
  `c:EventStore.subscribe_to_stream/4`.

  ## Notification message

  Events will be sent to the subscriber, in batches, as `{:events, events}`
  where events is a collection of `EventStore.RecordedEvent` structs.

  ## Example

  @doc """
  Create a persistent subscription to a single stream.

  The `subscriber` process will be notified of each batch of events appended to
  the single stream identified by `stream_uuid`.

    - `stream_uuid` is the stream to subscribe to.
      Use the `$all` identifier to subscribe to events from all streams.

    - `subscription_name` is used to uniquely identify the subscription.

    - `subscriber` is a process that will be sent `{:events, events}`
      notification messages.

    - `opts` is an optional map providing additional subscription configuration:

      - `name` the name of the event store if provided to `start_link/1`.

      - `start_from` is a pointer to the first event to receive.
        It must be one of:
          - `:origin` for all events from the start of the stream (default).
          - `:current` for any new events appended to the stream after the
            subscription has been created.
          - any positive integer for a stream version to receive events after.

      - `selector` to define a function to filter each event, i.e. returns
        only those elements for which fun returns a truthy value.

      - `mapper` to define a function to map each recorded event before sending
        to the subscriber.

      - `concurrency_limit` defines the maximum number of concurrent subscribers
        allowed to connect to the subscription. By default only one subscriber
        may connect. If too many subscribers attempt to connect to the
        subscription an `{:error, :too_many_subscribers}` is returned.

      - `buffer_size` limits how many in-flight events will be sent to the
        subscriber process before acknowledgement of successful processing. This
        limits the number of messages sent to the subscriber and stops their
        message queue from getting filled with events. Defaults to one in-flight
        event.

      - `partition_by` is an optional function used to partition events to
        subscribers. It can be used to guarantee processing order when multiple
        subscribers have subscribed to a single subscription. The function is
        passed a single argument (an `EventStore.RecordedEvent` struct) and must
        return the partition key. As an example to guarantee events for a single
        stream are processed serially, but different streams are processed
        concurrently, you could use the `stream_uuid` as the partition key.

          ```
          by_stream = fn %EventStore.RecordedEvent{stream_uuid: stream_uuid} -> stream_uuid end

          {:ok, _subscription} =
            EventStore.subscribe_to_stream(stream_uuid, "example", self(),
              concurrency_limit: 10,
              partition_by: by_stream
            )
          ```


  The subscription will resume from the last acknowledged event if it already
  exists. It will ignore the `start_from` argument in this case.

  Returns `{:ok, subscription}` when subscription succeeds.

  ## Notification messages

  Subscribers will initially receive a `{:subscribed, subscription}` message
  once the subscription has successfully subscribed.

  After this message events will be sent to the subscriber, in batches, as
  `{:events, events}` where events is a collection of `EventStore.RecordedEvent`
  structs.

  ## Example

      {:ok, subscription} = EventStore.subscribe_to_stream(stream_uuid, "example", self())

      # wait for the subscription confirmation
      receive do
        {:subscribed, ^subscription} ->
          IO.puts "Successfully subscribed to stream: " <> inspect(stream_uuid)
      end

      receive do
        {:events, events} ->
          IO.puts "Received events: " <> inspect(events)

          # acknowledge receipt
          EventStore.ack(subscription, events)
      end
